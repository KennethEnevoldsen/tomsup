        ## Issues and Usage Q&A
        
        To ask questions, report issues or request features, please use the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/stanfordnlp/issues).
        
        ## Setup
        
        StanfordNLP supports Python 3.6 or later. We strongly recommend that you install PACKAGENAME from PyPI. If you already have [pip installed](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/), simply run:
        ```bash
        pip3 install tomsup
        ```
        
        Or to install it from github run
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/KennethEnevoldsen/tomsup.git
        cd tomsup
        pip3 install -e .
        ```
        
        ## Getting Started with PACKAGENAME
        
        ```python
        >>> import tomsup
        >>> 
        ```
        
        The output should look something like:
        
        ```
        ('Barack', '200000', 'sampleoutput')
        ```
        
        **Note:** There is probably things you would want to write a note on.
        
        
        See [our getting started guide](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanfordnlp/installation_usage.html#getting-started) for more details.
        
        ### A todolist:
        
        Need to have
        - rework of WSLS
        
        Nice to have:
        - Smart initialize ToM
        - reinforcement learner agent
